# Color Swatches
An app to help users determine review color options

As a designer, I want to review color options and see different shades to help make the best color choices.

Features:
Seachable database of all 144 named HTML colors
Random color button for inspiration
Standard color options are included to help the user get started
Hex codes for each shade are included, for easy implementation into web design
Each shade can be clicked, making it the main color and showing the lighter/darker shades based on it

Over 10 pages of colors to search through!

Technologies Used:
HTML
CSS
Javascript
jQuery

Instructions:

Upon startup, the user can search for a named color in the search bar, choose a named color in the sidebar, select "random color" or choose from the list of colors presented, navigating to other pages if necessary.
Once selected, the app will display the color as the main shade, with 2 darker and 2 lighter colors next to it below the main swatch
The app filters out duplicates, so the user may see less than 5 swatches based on the selected color.
The user can click the "clear" button to revert back to the landing page.
