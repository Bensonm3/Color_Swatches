# Color Swatches
An app to help users determine and review color options

As a designer, I want to review color options and see different shades to help make the best color choices.

**Features:**
<br/>
Seachable database of all 144 named HTML colors
<br/>
Random color button for inspiration
<br/>
Standard color options are included to help the user get started
<br/>
Hex codes for each shade are included, for easy implementation into web design
<br/>
Each shade can be clicked, making it the main color and showing the lighter/darker shades based on it
<br/>
Over 10 pages of colors to search through!
<br/><br/>

**Technologies Used:**
<br/>
HTML
<br/>
CSS
<br/>
Javascript
<br/>
jQuery
<br/><br/>

**Instructions:**
<br/>

Upon startup, the user can search for a named color in the search bar, choose a named color in the sidebar, select "random color" or choose from the list of colors presented, navigating to other pages if necessary.
<br/>
Once selected, the app will display the color as the main shade, with 2 darker and 2 lighter colors next to it below the main swatch
<br/>
The app filters out duplicates, so the user may see less than 5 swatches based on the selected color.
<br/>
The user can click the "clear" button to revert back to the landing page.
